#+title: wlsyshot (wlroots easy screenshot)

A useful script that simplifies screenshotting functions in Wlroots.

* Dependence
To run this script you need several applications:
 1) wofi;
 2) wl-clipboard;
 3) grim;
 4) swappy;
 5) slurp.
on Arch Linux it is possible to install all the dependencies with the pacman package manager, in the clearest and simplest way possible:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S wofi wl-clipboard grim slurp swappy 
#+end_src

* Support?
For those who want to support my projects you can help in two ways:
 1) Help me write code directly, contributing directly to projects even with simple translations;
 2) donate some change to [[https://ko-fi.com/nfvblog][KO-FI]].
